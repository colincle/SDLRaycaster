# SDLRaycaster

A first-person raycasting engine written from scratch in C. No game engine and
no raycasting library, just SDL2 for the window, input, image loading, and audio.
Everything from the renderer to the movement and collision system is
hand-written.

## Features

**Renderer**
- Textured raycaster with per-column wall casting and a floor and ceiling caster.
- Half-height blocks that rise from the floor or hang from the ceiling, holes you
  can look down and fall into, and pillars, all driven by the map characters.
- Multithreaded rendering, the screen is split into vertical strips across the
  available CPU cores using SDL threads.
- Z-buffer for correct depth ordering across the multithreaded render.
- Adjustable field of view, render downscaling, and an optional FPS cap with
  vsync.

**Movement and camera**
- Walking, running, jumping, crouching, and crawling, each with its own eye
  height and headroom checks.
- Gravity, falling, and smooth camera height transitions.
- Mouse look plus vertical look, with full gamepad support (analog sticks for
  move and look, buttons for the actions).
- Circle-based collision against the map.

**Game**
- Five hand-made levels ("chapters") dispatched through a function-pointer table,
  with triggers that carry the player state from one level into the next.
- Textured walls, floors, and ceilings, plus footstep audio through SDL2_mixer.

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard | Gamepad |
|---|---|---|
| Look around | Mouse | Right stick |
| Move | WASD | Left stick |
| Run | Shift | L3 |
| Jump | Space | Cross |
| Crouch | C | Circle |
| Crawl | Hold C | Hold Circle |
| Quit | Escape | |

## Requirements

Built and tested on macOS. It depends on SDL2, SDL2_image, and SDL2_mixer, and
uses a macOS system call to detect CPU cores, so a Linux build would need a small
change there.

Install the dependencies with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer
```

## Build and run

```sh
make        # build
make run    # build and launch
```

`make clean` removes the object files, `make fclean` also removes the binary,
`make re` rebuilds from scratch, and `make debug` builds with the address
sanitizer.

## Layout

```
src/game_init/      window, textures, sounds, maps, entities, startup
src/game_loop/      the frame: events, updates, rendering, sound, fps
  render/           raycaster, wall and floor/ceiling casting, z-buffer
  update_entities/  movement, camera, collisions, gravity
src/controls/       keyboard and gamepad input
src/utils/          map reading and helpers
src/debug/          optional minimap and on-screen debug output
include/SDLRaycaster.h  all types, settings, and prototypes
assets/                 textures, sounds, and the five maps
```

## Configuration

Everything tunable is a `#define` at the top of
[include/SDLRaycaster.h](include/SDLRaycaster.h). Change a value and rebuild with
`make re`.

**Settings**

| Define | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `DOWNSCALE` | 1 | Internal render-resolution divisor. The scene is drawn at the window size divided by this, then scaled up to fill it. 1 is full resolution, higher is faster but blockier. |
| `FOV` | 53 | Field of view, in degrees. |
| `FPS_CAP` | 121 | Upper limit on frames per second. |
| `DEFAULT_SPEED` | 2 | Base walking speed. Running raises it. |
| `MOUSE_SENSIT` | 0.03 | Mouse look sensitivity. |
| `JOY_SENSIT` | 2 | Gamepad stick look sensitivity. |
| `GRAVITY` | 80 | Strength of gravity applied while falling. |
| `COLLISION_RADIUS` | 0.3 | Player collision radius, in map cells. |
| `VSYNC` | TRUE | Sync rendering to the display refresh rate. |

**Debug flags** (all off by default)

| Define | What it does |
|---|---|
| `START_LEVEL` | Which level (0 to 4) to start on. |
| `SHOW_MINIMAP` | Draw the top-down minimap overlay. |
| `MINIMAP_BLOCK` | Size of each minimap cell, in pixels. |
| `SHOW_FPS` | Print the average FPS to the terminal twice a second. |
| `SHOW_POSITION` | Print the player position each frame. |
| `SHOW_DIRECTION` | Print the player facing vector each frame. |
| `SHOW_CAM_PLANE` | Print the camera plane vector each frame. |
| `PRINT_ENTITIES` | Print the parsed entities once at startup. |
| `PRINT_MAPS` | Print the parsed maps once at startup. |
